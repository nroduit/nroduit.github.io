Translation files are hosted and managed on the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/weasis/public/) website. Get an account at [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signin) and help to translate to your language! If your language is missing, just head over to Transifex and request a new language.

{{% notice warning %}}
**Text length**: The translations for many languages frequently exceed the length of the corresponding English source. It could be a problem for the layout of graphical components (e.g. buttons).

**Special characters**: Some characters representing values (%d, %s), newline (\\n) and HTML tags must not be translated. For other translating recommendations, see <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.transifex.com/#translating">Transifex help</a><br>
For special words or particular contexts look at the "Instructions" text box (gives explanations or definitions).

## Building Weasis-i18n

[weasis-i18n](https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-i18n) is the internationalization project (i18n) of Weasis. As a separate project, it can have its own release cycle. The [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org) fragments of plug-ins contain only the translation files which are merged during runtime to the matching module of the application.

To obtain daily built packages, see this [page](https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-i18n).

{{% notice note %}}
That means the weasis-i18n.war file can be deployed at any time, it does not need to follow the Weasis life cycle. The plug-in translation will be updated by Weasis only if the timestamp number has changed. This timestamp is set during the build phase described below.

Additional projects to obtain a full translation of Weasis:<br>
The [java-swing-dialogs](https://www.transifex.com/organization/weasis/dashboard/java-swing-dialogs) translations must be updated manually in the weasis-launcher module and [docking-frames](https://www.transifex.com/weasis/docking-frames) translations must be packaged witin the library.

### Prerequisites

1. JDK 11 or higher
2. Maven 3 or higher<br>
    If your computer is behind a proxy server, [configure maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html).
3. Git or directly download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-i18n)

### Getting the Source

To clone the repository, first install GIT and either clone using a graphical GIT client (such as Tortoise Git) or directly from the command line using the command:

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ git clone https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-i18n.git
{{< /highlight >}}

### Build the distribution

Go in the *weasis-i18n* directory, Compile and install all the plug-ins in the local Maven repository

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ mvn clean install -Dtransifex.token="<your-token>"
{{< /highlight >}}

All the APIs require to be authenticated. So the value "your-token" must be replaced by your generate token, see how to [get this token](https://docs.transifex.com/account/authentication) on Transifex.

Command if you are behind a proxy server:
{{< highlight bash >}}
$ mvn clean install -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost="host" -DproxyPort="port" -Dtransifex.token="<your-token>"
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% notice info %}}
The distribution files are located in the *weasis-i18n-dist/target/dist* folder.

### Apply the translations

The translation package can be built manually as described below or it is automatically built every 24 hours and can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-i18n#download-the-binary-package). When [Building Weasis](../building-weasis), the last package is downloaded automatically.

* In order to update Weasis with new translations, unzip weasis-i18n.zip and either:
  * Pass the weasis.i18n location into the [launch command](../weasis-protocol/#modify-the-launch-parameters):
{{< highlight bash >}}
$weasis:config pro="weasis.i18n <your-uri>"
$weasis:config pro="weasis.i18n file:/home/weasis-i18n-dist-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
$weasis:config pro="weasis.i18n https://<your-domain>/weasis-i18n-dist-3.0.0"
{{< /highlight >}}
  * Replace the files in the "bundle-i18n" folder where Weasis is installed (not possible when Weasis is distributed from an application store or the Mac signed package).

{{% notice note %}}
weasis-launcher-i18n cannot be updated dynamically as the launcher is not an OSGi module. It must be imported manually into the Weasis source (weasis-launcher).
