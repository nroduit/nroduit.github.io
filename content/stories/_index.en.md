Weasis, the latest medical imaging software developed at the [University Hospital of Geneva (HUG)](https://www.hug.ch/en), serves as the clinical viewer for the hospital’s in-house Electronic Medical Records system. Since becoming open source in 2010, Weasis has earned its place as a reference DICOM viewer for medical professionals worldwide.

The University Hospital of Geneva has a remarkable legacy in developing medical imaging software. In 1990, HUG introduced Osiris, the first radiological imaging viewer to be freely distributed globally. Building on its success, [OsiriX](https://www.osirix-viewer.com/about/story/) was launched in 2003 as the Mac-based successor to Osiris, further cementing HUG’s leadership in medical imaging innovation.
