The latest software developed at the [University Hospital of Geneva (HUG)](https://www.hug.ch/en) for medical imaging is Weasis which is the clinical viewer in the home-made Electronic Medical Records. Weasis is [open source](https://github.com/nroduit/Weasis/) since 2010 and has become a reference DICOM viewer.

The University Hospital of Geneva has a long history of medical imaging software. Starting in 1990 at HUG, Osiris was the first radiological imaging viewer freely distributed around the world and then in 2003 [OsiriX](https://www.osirix-viewer.com/about/story/) was the Mac successor to Osiris.
