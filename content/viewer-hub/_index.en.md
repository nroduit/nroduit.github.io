**ViewerHub** is the successor to [weasis-pacs-connector](https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-pacs-connector). This is a server component with an administration interface for managing preferences, plugins and versions of Weasis with DICOM archives.

Essentially, it simplifies the management of Weasis in IT environments and facilitates connections to DICOM archives.

The main features of ViewerHub are:
- Management of Weasis user preferences
- Control of launch contexts and profiles by user, group, or host
- Handling of live minor version updates of Weasis at the client side
- Management of Weasis translation packages
- Integration with connectors for DICOM archives
- Configuration of Keycloak clients and token transmission for DICOMWeb or WADO URI calls
