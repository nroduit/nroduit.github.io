To easily manage your computer network, ViewerHub allows the creation and association of user or host groups.

## Creation

Users, hosts, user groups and host groups are represented by ‘targets’.

There are 4 types of target:
- user
- host
- user group
- host group

To create a target, go to the ‘association’ menu and define the type of target to be created.

## Group association

To associate a target with a group or a host/user, look for the desired target in the target name section and add the group or host/user in the ‘Belongs to/Member of’ section.

It is possible to associate several users with a user group and several hosts with a host group.
