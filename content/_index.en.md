# <center>Weasis Medical Viewer</center>

Weasis is a multipurpose standalone and web-based DICOM viewer with a highly [modular architecture](basics/architecture). It is a very popular clinical viewer used in healthcare by hospitals, health networks, multicenter research trials, and patients.

Weasis DICOM viewer is cross-platform, free/libre and open source software ([FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)), [multi-language](https://www.transifex.com/weasis/weasis/) and allows [a flexible integration to PACS, RIS, HIS or PHR](basics/customize/integration). This multi-platform DICOM viewer runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It allows high-quality renderings with high performance through the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) library.

It has been designed to meet several expectations of clinical information systems and their future evolution regarding medical imaging: providing web-based access to radiological images, as well as covering a considerable number of DICOM types and offering multimedia capabilities.

Weasis can display the content of most DICOM files including multi-frame, enhanced, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MIME Encapsulation, SR, PR, KOS, AU, RT and ECG. It has a high level of DICOM implementation, see [the viewer features](https://github.com/nroduit/Weasis#general-features).
