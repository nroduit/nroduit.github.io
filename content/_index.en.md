Weasis is a multipurpose standalone and web-based DICOM viewer with a highly [modular architecture](basics/architecture). It is a very popular clinical viewer used in healthcare by hospitals, health networks, multicenter research trials, and patients.

Weasis DICOM viewer is cross-platform, free/libre and open source software ([FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)), [multi-language](https://www.transifex.com/weasis/weasis/) and allows [a flexible integration to PACS, RIS, HIS or PHR](basics/customize/integration).
