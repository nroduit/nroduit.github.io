It has been designed to meet several expectations of clinical information systems and their future evolution regarding medical imaging: providing web-based access to radiological images, as well as covering a considerable number of DICOM types and offering multimedia capabilities.

Here are the main features:
* Display all kinds of DICOM files (including multi-frame, enhanced, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MIME Encapsulation, SR, PR, KOS, AU, RT and ECG)
* Viewer for common image formats (TIFF, BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, RAS, HDR, and PNM)
* Image manipulation (pan, zoom, windowing, presets, rotation, flip, scroll, crosshair, filtering...)
* Layouts for comparing series or studies
* Advanced series synchronization options
* Display Presentation States (GSPS) and Key Object Selection
* Create key images (Key Object Selection object) by selection
* Support of Modality LUTs, VOI LUTs, and Presentation LUTs (even non-linear)
* Support of several screens with different calibration, support of HiDPI (High Dots Per Inch) monitors, full-screen mode
* Multiplanar reconstructions and Maximum Intensity Projection
* Display Structured Reports
* Display and search into all DICOM attributes
* Display cross-lines
* Measurement and annotation tools
* Region statistics of pixels (Min, Max, Mean, StDev, Skewness, Kurtosis, Entropy)
* Histogram of modality values
* SUV measurement
* DICOM Send (storeSCU and STOW-RS)
* DICOM Query/Retrieve (C-GET, C-MOVE and WADO-URI) and DICOMWeb (QUERY and RETRIEVE)
* Save measurements and annotations in DICOM PR or XML file
* Import CD/DVD and local DICOM files
* Export DICOM with several options (DICOMDIR, ZIP, ISO image file with Weasis, generate new UIDs, transcoding, TIFF, JPEG, PNG...)
* Magnifier glass with advanced display options
* Native and DICOM printing
* Read DICOM image containing float or double data (Parametric Map)
* DICOM ECG Viewer
* Dicomizer module to convert standard images into DICOM

Weasis can display the content of most DICOM files with a high level of implementation of the DICOM standard.
