Weasis has been designed to meet the evolving needs of clinical information systems in medical imaging. Its features focus on providing web-based access to radiological images, supporting a wide range of DICOM types, and offering multimedia capabilities.

### Key Viewer Features (see also [Tutorials](tutorials))

- **Data type support**
  - Weasis provides a highly detailed implementation of the DICOM standard, enabling effortless display and interaction with most types of DICOM files.
  - Display most DICOM files including multi-frame, enhanced, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MIME Encapsulation, DOC, SR, PR, KOS, SEG, AU, RT, and ECG
  - Display DICOM image containing float or double data (Parametric Map)
  - Import DICOM files with DICOM Query/Retrieve (C-GET, C-MOVE and WADO-URI) and DICOMWeb (QUERY and RETRIEVE)
  - Import and export DICOM CD/DVD with DICOMDIR
  - Import and export DICOM ZIP files
  - Viewer for common image formats (TIFF, BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, RAS, HDR, and PNM)

- **Exporting data**
  - Export DICOM files locally with several options (DICOMDIR, ZIP, ISO image file with Weasis, TIFF, JPEG, PNG...)
  - Send DICOM files to a remote PACS or DICOMWeb server (C-STORE or STOW-RS)
  - Save measurements and annotations in DICOM Presentation States or XML file

- **Viewing and image rendering**
  - Support of several screens with different calibration, support of HiDPI (High Dots Per Inch) monitors, full-screen mode
  - Image manipulation with mouse buttons  (pan, zoom, windowing, rotation, scroll, crosshair)
  - Support of DICOM Modality LUTs, VOI LUTs, LUT Shapes, and Presentation LUTs (even non-linear)
  - Apply DICOM Presentation States (GSPS) and display graphics as overlays
  - Support DICOM Overlays, Shutters, and DICOM Pixel Padding
  - Volume rendering with 3D presets
