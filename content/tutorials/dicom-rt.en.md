The region tree has context menus that allow you to:
* **Select/Unselect all the child nodes** (only for parent): Quickly toggle visibility for all subregions within a parent category
* **Fill opacity**: Controls the transparency of the region's interior relative to its border
    - Default value: 20%
    - Calculation: Final opacity = Line opacity Ã— Fill opacity
    - Example: 80% line opacity + 20% fill opacity = 16% perceived interior opacity
* **Export to clipboard as CSV**: Exports comprehensive region data including volume measurements and dose calculations to CSV format via clipboard, enabling seamless integration with external analysis tools and spreadsheet applications.
* **Pixel statistics from the selected view** (only for leaf): Analyzes pixel values within the region boundaries
    - Provides comprehensive statistical data for the enclosed area
    - For detailed parameter definitions, refer to [Pixel Statistics](../draw-measure/#selected-measurement)
